				<p style="font-size: 20px">The interface of the CVS self-checkout is trying to solve the problem of having everyone go to the cashier. By providing another
					checkout option, it reduces congestion. Its key components include instructions to start scanning, the option to put your phone number in to check for extracare coupons, and the ability to choose
					a preferred payment option. When clicking on the phone number option a keypad pops up. When pressing a preferred payment option, further instructions appear to conduct the payment.
					Moreover, there is the option to change to Spanish when clicking on the "Español" option. </p>

						I observed that most users didn't have trouble navigating the UI. It appeared that some people were spending a noticeable amount of time
						on the phone number input for coupons. Every user I observed appeared to be relatively content and not too rushed. Users seemed
						to know exactly how to start the process by scanning, and all seemed comfortable with the payment options.

						<li>Did the UI clearly convey the different types of payment methods?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Most of the people I observed seemed to pay with card, and those I talked to
							were not confused about how to do this. However, a particular individual was confused about
							whether or not Apple Pay was supported.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Was initiating the scanning process clear to you? </li>
						<ul>
							<li>Aligning with my observations, most people described that the directions on the
							screen made it straightforward to start the process by scanning the items below the screen.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Was the option to use coupons clear to you?</li>
						<ul>
							<li> Most people that I asked were well versed with how the extra-care card coupon works,
							and knew to put in their phone number to see if they had any funds. There was an individual who did not
							know about this but was not interested. </li>
						</ul>
						<li>Was it clear on how to revert/undo scans? </li>
						<ul>
							<li> None of the people that I interviewed needed to undo any of the scans as
							they wanted to purchase all the products they carried. It was mentioned that they would use the "Request Help" option if needed
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							In terms of language options, were the different options easy to navigate?
							<ul>
								<li> All of those that I interviewed had English as their primary language,
								so there wasn't a need for them to look at different options. However, some noted that
								they saw the "Español" option. </li>
